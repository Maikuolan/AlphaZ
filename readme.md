# AlphaZ PHP Framework

**Note:** This repository contains the core files of the alphaz framework. If you want to build an application using alphaz,
visit the main [alphaz repository](https://github.com/alphazframework/alphaz).

Who is AlphaZ For?
AlphaZ is for PHP developers who want to build apps instead of coding common things like validation, routing, database manipulation, etc, from scratch. AlphaZ offers a set of well-defined toolkits that take care of those things allowing you to focus on building your app.

The purpose of AlphaZ Framework
As for PHP, there are many PHP frameworks available nowadays, so the question is raised as to why we/people should use AlphaZ. The main purpose of AlphaZ framework is to provide a very lightweight framework without any external dependencies except core and autoloader.
